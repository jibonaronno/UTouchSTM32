# UTouchSTM32
UTouch Library for STM32

This library is created to implement UTouch Library on STM32F4xx and to support TFTLCD 3.5 Inch from MCUFRIEND. STM32F4Disco board is used for example program. GPIOD pins are configured to interface Touch Controller pins. Description from https://mvdlande.wordpress.com/2015/02/18/mcufriend-3-5inch-for-mega2560-tft-touch-shield/ page says that it uses ads7843 touch controller which is an ADC to interface 4 wire touchscreen. The two channel ADC values represents X and Y values. It is required to apply some technique to acquire proper XY values. The definitions and functions are implemented in touchDriver.h and touchDriver.c file. A test function uint32_t touch_TestRead(void) in touchDriver.c is written to get only Y values. Present project only read the Y value and send it to serial port to test the touch controller only. Note that this project has also SDCARD and FATFS intigretions from https://github.com/MaJerle. We will discuss those features in separate branch later.
