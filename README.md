# UTouchSTM32
UTouch Library for STM32

This library is created to implement UTouch Library on STM32F4xx and to support TFTLCD 3.5 Inch from MCUFRIEND. STM32F4Disco board is used for example program. GPIOD pins are configured to interface Touch Controller pins. Description from https://mvdlande.wordpress.com/2015/02/18/mcufriend-3-5inch-for-mega2560-tft-touch-shield/ page says that it uses ads7843 touch controller which is an ADC to interface 4 wire touchscreen.
